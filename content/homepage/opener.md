Cats and Poems is a micro redesigner studio located at Folkestone, UK.

We create unique jeans, dungarees (or overalls), and cute pinafore denim dresses. Each pair of jeans is sourced from second hand or thrift shops (we don’t really need to make more jeans with the absulute humongous amount of clothing produced every day). The sourced jeans are washed and deconstructed before the creation process begins.

Each pair of jeans contains pieces of denim skirts, other pair of jeans, new fresh denim, cool fabric, at least one phone pocket, and hand painted cat and a poem written by a local artist.

Sustainability and Community, these are the two values we embrace very deeply. We aim to make the world a better place by helping others.
