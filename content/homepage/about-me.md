##### Cats and Poems

It all started with buying the wrong size of jeans... I really liked them, but they were too small, so, I did what anyone with a sewing machine and good pair of scissors would do: alter them. I ended up creating an early design of what my daughter calls **jivans** (Ivan's Jeans).

I used that lovely **Dia de Los Muertos** fabric, and between the fabric, the pockets and the other additions to patch the jeans, I ended up creating a very nice pair of jeans.

While wearing my jeans or jivans, people used to praise them: an old lady came to me while walking to the dog to tell me she really loved my jeans ðŸ’œ which I really appreciate. Friends kept telling me that I had to sell my jeans, so, here we are, my humble attempt to sell nice jeans with cats and poems.
